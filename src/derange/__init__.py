Compress lists of integers to range objects

Do you have a list of integers?  Do you want to know what ranges of consecutive
values the list covers?  Do you need to solve a `gaps and islands
<https://stackoverflow.com/tags/gaps-and-islands/info>`_ problem outside of
SQL?  Maybe you have a list of dates and need to find the longest streak of
consecutive days on which something happened.  No?  Why not?  Well, either way,
the `derange` module is here for you, ready to solve all these problems and a
couple more.

Visit <https://github.com/jwodder/derange> for more information.
